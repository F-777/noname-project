# About Sierpinski 

<p>
  The Sierpiński triangle, also called the Sierpiński gasket or Sierpiński sieve, is a fractal with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, <br>
  subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles. Originally constructed as a curve, this is one of the basic examples of self-similar sets—that is, <br>
  it is a mathematically generated pattern that is reproducible at any magnification or reduction. It is named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński, <br>
  but appeared as a decorative pattern many centuries before the work of Sierpiński.<br>

# History Of Sierpinski 

<p>
  Wacław Sierpiński described the Sierpiński triangle in 1915. <br>
  However, similar patterns appear already as a common motif of 13th-century Cosmatesque inlay stonework. <br>
</p>

The Apollonian gasket was first described by Apollonius of Perga (3rd century BC) <br>
and further analyzed by Gottfried Leibniz (17th century), and is a curved precursor <br>
of the 20th-century Sierpiński triangle.
